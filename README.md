# Invisibility Cloak
### The Invisibility Cloak is a fun and interactive Python project that uses computer vision to create an "invisibility" effect, similar to Harry Potter's invisibility cloak. By leveraging OpenCV and a colored cloth (e.g., a green screen), the project removes the background of a specific color and replaces it with a static or dynamic background, making objects appear invisible.
This project is built using Python and relies on libraries like OpenCV and NumPy for real-time video processing.
